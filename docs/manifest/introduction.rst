Objectives
----------

Develop a health-commodity delivery platform for developing country health systems beginning with a low-
cost, full-feature Logistics Management Information System (LOMIS) targeted ﬁrst at the middle of the
vaccine delivery system in Nigeria.


Rationale
---------

The Local Government Area (LGA) and satellite levels of the national vaccine supply chain constitute the
delivery system’ pivot. Providing a full feature platform satisfying the functional and business requirements for
the LGA, extending targeted supply management tools to the health facilities they supply, and interoperating
with DHIS2 will enable data-driven forecasting and supply balancing through greater visibility and control.


Donors driving national and state levels toward adopting a large ERP, itself too expensive and heavy to adapt
for lower levels, leaves the LGA, satellite store, ward and health facility without a solution for managing
inventory and logistics. Returns from only ﬁxing the national and state level systems will be limited without the
visibility required for rational forecasting. This gap will likely drive demand for more locally appropriate
solutions. The window of time needed to develop and deploy the larger ERP provides eHA with the runway
necessary to gain sticky share at these lower levels. It will be the state and national level ERP system that will
need to interoperate if not integrate with LOMIS, potentially providing a channel into these markets.


Strategy
--------

**Strategic Integration & Broadly Interoperable.** LOMIS must be as open and full-service to add as much
value as possible in a low willingness-to-pay market class, consolidate divergent programmatic needs, and
maximize stickiness. We should integrate and enhance programmatic and operational tools, like DHIS 2.0
the Vaccine Volume Calculator, Logistimo applications, GIS-driven logistics and route support, and ﬂeet
management capabilities. The system should ensure interoperability with OpenLMIS, multiple temperature
monitoring and systems, and possibly with Microsoft Navision.


**Ofﬂine First.** Phones with data plans and stick-enabled laptops installed throughout the supply system will
likely accompany rollout but the system must be robust and functional ofﬂine. This is a key differentiator and
essential element to sustainability. Packaging the system as a Google Chrome application, which also works
on Android mobile devices, allows local, ofﬂine processing, and rapid scale and versioning. Further extending
LOMIS to basic phone and SMS systems and targeted paper-form integration when necessary will keep
LOMIS relevant across the spectrum of supportability environments, user qualiﬁcations, and process volatility.


**User-Centered.** With activity-based interfaces, automated workﬂows, easy-to-use hard-to-fail forms, and
good information design are the only ways to drive system-wide adoption and sustainability. Investing in ﬁeld
research, including interviews and user testing, must be built into the development and piloting process.


**Implementation & Support.** eHA has an asset in its robust country presence. The ability to observe and
train users, implement, support and grow the system to fulﬁll Nigeria’s speciﬁc needs reduces deployment
time and costs and bolsters an aggressive platform-as-a-service model.
